# Binary search

## What is it?

1. Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a *sorted* array. It is also known as: logarithmic search, binary chop, half-interval search.
3. It is used as an interview question you can encounter while searching for a job as a programmer: *given a sorted array `arr[]` of `n` elements, write a function to search a given element `x` in `arr[]`*.

## About the code

The code consists of the three functions:
1. `find_naive()` - this function is an implementation of the linear search; it is an easy to understand code that finds the position of a particular value in an *unsorted* array.
2. `find_in_sorted()` - this function is an iterative implementation of the binary search that finds the position of a particular value in a *sorted* array.
3. `main()` - this function shows the comparison results of the two searching functions to prove the code is working properly.
